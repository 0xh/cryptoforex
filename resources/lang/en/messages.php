    'text3' => '<strong id="q3">Setting the indicator</strong>
          <p>We recommend leaving the default settings for the period and the deviation of 20 and 2.0, respectively.</p>
          <p>If desired, you can also change the color and thickness of the indicator lines.</p>
          <p>By the way, the best is for the trade chart "Japanese candles" with a timeframe of 5 or 15 minutes.</p>

    'text4' => '<strong id="q4">How to read Bollinger signals</strong>
          <p>The main components of the indicator are the lines, namely 3 simple moving averages.</p>
          <p>The central line, moving behind the chart, demonstrates the direction of the trend.</p>
          <p>The upper and lower lines form a price corridor. Exit the chart beyond its limits and is a signal to open a deal.</p>

          <p>"Japanese Standard" is a trend strategy based on the identification of candle patterns.</p>
          <p>The signal for opening a deal is the appearance of a candle of a different color, which overlaps the previous candles.</p>

          <strong id="q5">What do candle models say?</strong>
          <p>Watching how not only the color of candles changes, but also their size, you will receive a signal for opening deals.</p>
          <p>Within this strategy, you need to learn how to identify two candle patterns.</p>
          <p>First, when there is 1 candle, the body of which covers the previous or previous candles of the opposite color.</p>
          <p>For example, the body of a red candle blocks the bodies of green. This indicates a possible beginning of a downtrend.</p>
          <div>
            <img src="../images/ya3.png" alt="">
          </div>
          <p>If the green candle covers the length of the red, the price is likely to follow up.</p>
          <div>
            <img src="../images/ya4.png" alt="">
          </div>
          <p>The second model, when not 1, and 2 candles cover the body of a candle of a different color.</p>
          <p>For example, when 2 small red candles blocked 1 green. This suggests that the downward movement is likely to continue.</p>
          <div>
            <img src="../images/ya5.png" alt="">
          </div>
          <p>Or when 2 green candles have blocked the previous red, indicates a probable continuation of the uptrend.</p>
